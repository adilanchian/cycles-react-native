# Cycles V2 React Native

## Why?
Currently [Cycles - Daily Habit Creator](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/cycles-daily-habit-creator/id1197611525) is out in the App Store. It hasn't been updated in quite a long time. People still use it, I still get support emails from it, and I it seems like people do truly love it! I always find myself coming back to this project, so I thought I would go ahead and rebuild it in a more proper way. The main goal here is to setup some passive income from this application and log the journey!

## Why React Native?
Not only have people been using this on iOS many people have asked me to build it for Android. Alas - here we are.

## Sections to build

### Website Update
- [ ] Need to update (and redepoly) https://getcyclesapp.com. Compeltely ded atm.

### Onboarding Flow
- [ ] Get people signed up with Cycles in max 3 steps. This should take them through the following:
  - [ ] Creating an optional account
  - [ ] Creating first Cycle

### Cycles List
- [ ] Should include the ability to view all the Cycles you have created as well as Add/Edit/Delete Cycles

### Cycle Packs
- [ ] Get 1-5 endorsements for habit packs that will allow people to work on habits that top tier people use. For example, habits from FANG engineers or habits from successful content creators.

### Server Side
- [ ] Setup AWS server side to interact with Cycles and give the ability for people to log onto different platforms and have their items synced across devices

### Notification Logic
- [ ] I pride myself in the trash notificaton logic that I built for v1. It wasn't robust, but this time around I want it to be! Build the logic behind making it seem like the user doesn't have to do anything

### Redesign
- [ ] Time for a redesign. I'm not sure who will do this, but I'm thinking I want to take a stab at it

### Analytics
- [ ] I want to be as data driven as possible! Add some analytics that will make sense


## Final Thoughts
I believe this will this will grow (obviously), but I do hope to take my learnings from ZipSchool and apply them in a way that will get Cycles v2 ASAP. I want to build something good, but at the same time don't mind if some of the code is garbage. Let's get it out there and see what people think!
